Hi, we’re Jessica and Michael — a couple of wine-loving, energy-efficient dreamers building our forever home one carefully researched decision at a time. This blog documents the journey: the wins, the learnings, and the inevitable "did we think this through?" moments.

#### About the Build

We’re creating a modern farmhouse with Hamptons-inspired style — but the real priority is getting the fundamentals right. We’ve put a lot of thought into the slab, orientation, framing, insulation, and roofing to ensure long-term comfort and performance.

Finishing details like paint or plaster? That can wait. We're focused on the stuff that's hard to fix later

#### What Matters Most

- **Energy Efficiency** – Smart orientation, thermally efficient framing, and climate-specific roof and eave design to maximise passive performance.
- **Liveability** – A consistently comfortable home without needing to rely on air conditioning.
- **Documentation** – Every decision is being recorded — right down to a detailed as-built 3D model.
- **Home Automation** – We're designing around an open-source KNX-based system for long-term flexibility and control.

#### Our Experience (and Limitations)

We're not builders. Our experience is mixed, and we’ve learned a lot along the way. But we know how to research well, we know what we don’t know, and we’re not afraid to ask the right people — or verify things ourselves.

**About Michael & His Experience**

I grew up helping my parents renovate, including a detached garage build with a bathroom and living space. That early exposure stuck.

Now, I work in IT — covering software, project management, and infrastructure — but I also work closely with our in-house facilities team on major projects. I’ve specified comms rooms and server spaces, reviewed electrical and mechanical engineering plans, overseen contract work, and handled CCTV, access control, and security layouts. I also have hands-on experience with KNX and CBUS automation systems.

The result? A solid understanding of what makes a high-reliability space work — and how to translate that into a liveable home.

**Jessica's Experience**

Jessica’s building experience is limited — though she’s mastered the art of the Pinterest board. While she’s happy to leave the wiring diagrams and compliance codes to Michael, she has a clear vision for how the house should feel. She brings the design eye, veto power, and crucial reminders that technical doesn’t always equal comfortable.
