Hi, we're Jessica and Michael — a couple of wine-loving, energy-efficient dreamers building our forever home one decision (and debate) at a time. We swapped late-night Netflix for thermal insulation specs and building code PDFs, and now spend weekends comparing window seals like connoisseurs compare Shiraz.

This blog is our way of documenting the journey: the highs, the hiccups, and the inevitable "we should've known better" moments. Whether you're here for passive house tips, building inspiration, or just to see if we survive the process with our marriage intact — welcome!

#### About Our Build

We're building a modern farmhouse with Hamptons-inspired style, but our real focus is on getting the fundamentals right — particularly the substructure (slab), orientation, and superstructure elements like framing, insulation, and roofing.

Since this is our forever home, I’m less concerned about finishing details like paintwork and plastering — those are things I can improve or touch up over time. But the core structure? That needs to be right from the start, because it’s a lot harder to fix later.

#### Goals & Objectives

- **Energy Efficiency** – We've focused on correct orientation, thermally efficient framing, and a roof design tailored to our climate — right down to the eave lengths — to maximise passive performance and minimise energy use.
- **Liveability** – The goal is a home that stays comfortable year-round without constantly reaching for the air conditioner. Consistent temperatures, no draughts, and no hot or cold spots.
- **Documentation** – I love a good spec sheet. So naturally, I'm documenting the entire build — every decision, detail, and deviation — all the way down to a complete as-built 3D model, including framing and service layouts. If it exists, it'll be recorded.
- **Home Automation** – The house is being designed from the ground up around an open-source home automation system, built on KNX and integrated with a mix of other components for flexibility, reliability, and long-term control.

#### Our Experience: Confident, Not Naive

Our experience with residential builds is limited and varied — we won't pretend to be experts, because we're not. But we've picked up a fair bit over the years. What we may lack in hands-on building credentials, we make up for with strong research skills, a healthy respect for the complexity of the process, and the self-awareness not to overestimate what we know.

**About Michael & His Experience**

Growing up, I lived in a house that was constantly evolving. My parents were always working on renovations — and I was right there alongside them. As a teenager, I helped build a detached garage with a bathroom, living area and an extra bedroom. That experience gave me a solid appreciation for what goes into building and modifying a home — and how much you learn by doing.

Professionally, I work in IT across software engineering, project management, and leadership roles — but my day-to-day goes well beyond traditional IT. I work closely with our in-house facilities team on all major infrastructure and building projects.

Over the years, I've gained significant experience specifying communications rooms, server rooms, and broader data centre environments. My role has extended into the design and coordination of electrical and mechanical services, where I regularly review engineering drawings, ensure compliance with relevant standards, and manage project delivery and contracts.

We also manage our CCTV, security, and access control systems entirely in-house, which has given me practical experience in access control, security layouts, and floor plan development. Through all of this, I've worked closely with a wide range of trades — from plumbers and plasterers to builders and sparkies — giving me a well-rounded perspective that bridges IT, engineering, and the physical environment.

Additionally, I have experience with KNX and CBUS automation systems, programming and hardware.

It's given me a well-rounded understanding of both the technical and practical aspects of building and operating high-reliability spaces — a background that I hope will prove to be invaluable during our own build.

Above all, I'm a prolific and efficient researcher. I don't pretend to know everything — and I'm certainly not naive enough to ignore expert advice. I value & seek out professional opinions and make a point to listen carefully, but I also believe in verifying things for myself wherever possible.

**Jessica's Experience**

Jessica's building experience is limited — unless you count building a Pinterest board at 2am. She's not here to read technical specs or decipher council paperwork; she’s here to make sure the house feels like a home (and that Michael doesn't sneak in a data rack disguised as a pantry). While she leaves the construction jargon to him, she has a very clear vision of what she wants.

She brings the taste, the veto power, and the gentle reminders that "livable" matters just as much as "technically impressive."
