Hi, we're Jessica and Michael — a couple of wine-loving, energy-efficient dreamers building our forever home one decision (and debate) at a time. We swapped late-night Netflix for thermal insulation specs and building code PDFs, and now spend weekends comparing window seals like connoisseurs compare Shiraz.

This blog is our way of documenting the journey: the highs, the hiccups, and the inevitable "we should've known better" moments. Whether you're here for passive house tips, building inspiration, or just to see if we survive the process with our marriage intact — welcome!
