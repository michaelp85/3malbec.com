summary: "My second, and accepted attempt at DA with fixes to septic plans, site plan and other additional information requested by Council."

After my first DA required some tweaks to the effluent disposal area and a few adjustments to the site plan, I went back to the drawing board. Armed with an updated report from our wastewater engineer and a corrected site layout, I was ready to have another crack at it.

As someone going through the DA process for the first time, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect — but here’s how things unfolded:

- June 9 – I submitted the Development Application via the NSW Planning Portal.
- June 12 – I lodged the Section 68 application (under the Local Government Act). This took a couple of extra days… honestly, I can’t even remember why.
- June 20 – Council emailed requesting additional information and payment within two days. I paid immediately.
- June 23 – Payment was accepted and the DA was formally accepted for assessment. It’s official: the application was now lodged.
- June 27 – I received notification that the DA is on public exhibition... except it wasn’t. The actual exhibition period runs from 4 July to 18 July 2025.

So now, we wait. The exhibition period is just around the corner — and hopefully the next update involves less paperwork and more progress.
