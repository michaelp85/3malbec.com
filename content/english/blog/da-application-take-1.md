summary: "My first ever attempt at submitting a Development Application."

This was my first ever attempt at submitting a Development Application via the NSW Planning Portal. I had come prepared with all the required information, including:

- Site Plans with elevations and floor plans, all beautifully created in Sketchup and Layout
- BASIX
- Bushfire Kit
- Estimated Costs
- Owners Consent
- Statement of Environment Effects

Yass Council reviewed the documentation and identified that our effluent disposal report prepared by our wastewater engineer differed to what I had in the site plan. What had happened is the engineering report had specified an effluent dispersal area that was assumed to be a sprinker-type system, but that's not what we'll intending to install.

I hadn't picked this up when reading the engineering report, plus I hadn't even told the engineer we'll wanting to use a sub-surface irrigation system. So there was a mismatch between what was specified and what was in the site plan.

To resolve this, I went back to our wastewater engineer (Richard Miller, from Land Compability Services) and he redid the report for me for a small fee with council then recommending I create an entirely new DA.
