Dealing with a dying tree. When we first bought the block, this old tree was already showing signs of decline - with it's lifeless limbs and bare canopy. I kept an eye on it for a few months but it became increasingly clear it was in distress and not good health. While we loved the idea of keeping it for it's shade, birdlife, and character after speaking with both a slab engineer and a telephone call with a arborist it had crossed the line from "rustic charm" to "safety hazard".

#### Why We Had to Remove It

I first spoke with an arborist over the phone, describing the tree's condition and sending through a photo. He called me back almost immediately and said, "Yeah, that tree’s well and truly gone." I tried to get him onsite for a proper evaluation, but he was adamant it wasn’t necessary. Still not entirely convinced, I did a bit more Googling and contacted a second arborist who agreed to meet me in person. After inspecting it onsite, he confirmed the same verdict—that it was beyond saving. He even pointed out nearby trees of the same species to show what a healthy one _should_ look like. The contrast was pretty clear.

It became clear that point that the tree had become a liability and had to go.

#### How We Removed It

We had Paul from [Red Gum Tree Services](https://redgumtreeservices.com.au/) create the arborist report/letter for council and completed the felling of the tree. Took Paul and his crew about ~6 hours start to finish.
